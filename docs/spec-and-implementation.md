# 🧶 Stricknani — Specification & Implementation

> “A Mealie for knitting.”

Stricknani is a self-hosted web app for managing knitting projects — think **Mealie**, but for knitters.
It lets users organize projects with photos, gauge calculations, and notes in a clean, modern interface.

## 1. Purpose & Vision

- Provide a modern, private, self-hosted space for knitters to document their projects.
- Recreate the quality and usability of Mealie, adapted for fiber arts.
- Focus on usability, reproducibility, and maintainability.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

- Don’t re-invent the wheel.
  Always use established Python libraries where possible (FastAPI auth/session middlewares, SQLAlchemy ORM, Jinja2, existing Markdown renderers, etc.).
- FastAPI + HTMX.
  Use FastAPI for API + server-side rendering (Jinja2 templates).
  Use HTMX for progressive enhancement and dynamic interactivity.
- Modern but simple.
  Avoid SPA frameworks. Keep it responsive, clean, and keyboard-friendly.
- Reproducible + portable.
  Built and tested through Nix + Docker, pushed to GHCR via CI.
- Privacy-respecting.
  No external analytics, no external asset CDN.

---

## 3. Core Use Cases

1. Create, update, and delete knitting projects.
2. Attach photos, diagrams, and notes.
3. Calculate stitch counts via the gauge tool.
4. Browse and filter projects.
5. Authenticate as a local user.

## 8. Developer Experience

### 8.1 Toolchain

| Tool          | Purpose                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Python 3.13+  | Language runtime         |
| uv            | Dependency management    |
| pytest        | Unit & integration tests |
| ruff          | Linter + formatter       |
| mypy (strict) | Type checking            |
| just          | Task runner              |
| nix           | Reproducible builds      |

### 8.2 Linting Policy

Linting is mandatory in CI.

- Ruff enforces style, formatting, and common error checks.
- MyPy runs in strict mode (`--strict`) for full typing discipline.
- All code must be Ruff- and MyPy-clean before merge.
- Optional pre-commit hooks run `ruff --fix` and `mypy`.

### 8.3 justfile Tasks (expected)

| Command            | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `just setup`       | Setup uv environment                |
| `just run`         | Run dev server with reload          |
| `just lint`        | Run Ruff + MyPy                     |
| `just fmt`         | Format code                         |
| `just trim`        | Trim trailing whitespace            |
| `just test`        | Run pytest                          |
| `just build-image` | Build Docker image                  |
| `just push-image`  | Push image to GHCR                  |
| `just check`       | Aggregate lint + test + i18n checks |
| `just demo-data`   | Seed demo user and sample projects  |
| `just demo-reset`  | Reset and re-seed demo data         |

### 8.4 Nix Flake

- `packages.${system}.stricknani` → runnable app
- `packages.${system}.stricknani-docker` → Docker image
- `devShells.${system}.default` → uv + just + pytest + ruff
- `checks` → build + tests + flake validation
- Reproducible build required.

---

## 9. Testing & CI Validation

- Unit: gauge math, auth, models.
- Integration: CRUD + uploads + session flows.
- CI runs:
  1. `ruff check .`
  2. `mypy .`
  3. `pytest -v`
  4. `nix flake check`
- Coverage ≥ 80%.
- Image verification: start container → `/healthz` returns 200.

## API Endpoints

### Health & Info

- `GET /healthz` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /` - Welcome message with version

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/signup` - Create new user account
- `POST /auth/login` - Login and get session cookie
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout and clear session
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info

### Projects

- `GET /projects/` - List all projects (with optional filters)
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Get single project details
- `POST /projects/` - Create new project
- `DELETE /projects/{id}` - Delete project

### Gauge Calculator

- `POST /gauge/calculate` - Calculate adjusted stitches and rows

### Android JSON API delta sync

- `GET /api/v1/sync/projects` and `GET /api/v1/sync/yarns` accept the existing
  `since=<iso8601>` cursor and return updated full-detail entities plus
  deletion tombstones in `deleted_ids`.
- For large initial or long-offline syncs, clients may add `limit=1..50`.
  The response then contains at most that many combined updated entities and
  deletion ids, with `has_more` and an opaque `next_cursor` when more data is
  available. Send that value as `cursor` for the next page; do not send
  `since` alongside it. The cursor keeps a fixed server snapshot and is bound
  to the entity type and authenticated user.
- Omitting `limit` preserves the original complete-response behavior for
  clients that do not yet implement pagination. Categories remain a small
  full-list sync because they have no audited `updated_at`/deletion feed.

## Usage

### Development

```bash
# Setup environment
just setup

# Run development server (port 7674)
just run

# Run tests
just test

# Run linters
just lint

# Format code
just fmt

# Seed demo data
just demo-data

# Run all checks
just check
```

### Production (Docker)

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t stricknani:latest .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  -p 7674:7674 \
  -v stricknani-data:/app/media \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here \
  ghcr.io/pschmitt/stricknani:latest
```

### Configuration

Environment variables:

- `SECRET_KEY` - JWT secret (required in production)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 7674 dev, 7674 prod)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `MEDIA_ROOT` - Media files directory
- `FEATURE_SIGNUP_ENABLED` - Enable/disable signups (default: true)

## Demo Data

Run `just demo-data` to create:

- Demo user: `demo@stricknani.local` / `demo`
- Sample projects: Baby Blanket, Winter Scarf, Spring Pullover, City Beanie, Lace Headband, Weekend Cardigan
- Sample yarns: Merino Soft, Sock Delight, Chunky Monkey, Linen Breeze, Alpaca Cloud, Highland Tweed
  Run `just demo-reset` to delete existing demo data and re-seed it.

## Technical Decisions

1. Replaced passlib with bcrypt directly
   - Passlib had compatibility issues with Python 3.14
   - Direct bcrypt usage is simpler and works perfectly

2. Python 3.14 Support
   - Application fully compatible with Python 3.14
   - All dependencies work correctly

3. Async-First Design
   - All database operations use async/await
   - Better performance and scalability

4. Type Safety
   - Strict MyPy configuration
   - Full type hints throughout codebase

## Conclusion

The core backend implementation of Stricknani is complete and functional. The application:

- Follows the specification architecture
- Uses established libraries (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, bcrypt)
- Has comprehensive test coverage
- Passes all linting and type checking
- Is containerized and ready for deployment
- Has reproducible builds via Nix
- Includes CI/CD pipeline

The foundation is solid and ready for UI development and additional features.
