# Documentation Map

Use this index to find the right document quickly.

- `../AGENTS.md`: operational development rules for coding agents
- `../TODO.md`: prioritized execution backlog (`Now`, `Next`, `Done`)
- `../README.md`: setup, runtime config, and day-to-day developer commands
- `spec-and-implementation.md`: full product specification and implementation summary snapshot

## Maintenance Rule

If content becomes long-lived reference material (spec/history), keep it in `docs/`.
Keep `AGENTS.md` and `TODO.md` short and execution-oriented.
